## About
This repository contains the final task project on temperature forecasting with Convolutional Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. The study case focuses on predicting temperature patterns in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, Indonesia.

## Abstract
The increase in air temperature due to climate change and global warming has raised concerns, especially in big cities like Jakarta. The impact of rising temperatures includes droughts, increased energy consumption, and extreme weather changes. To anticipate these changes, a model capable of forecasting air temperature is needed. This study employs Convolutional Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. ERA5 temperature data from Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta spanning five years (2017-2021) is used, with 80% of the data utilized for training. The models are then tested on the last year's data and short-term tests for 3, 7, and 14 days ahead. The forecasting results show that Conv-BiLSTM outperforms BiLSTM, attributed to its use of 1D convolutional layers for feature selection before inputting into BiLSTM. This study concludes that Conv-BiLSTM provides better performance in predicting both long and short-term temperature data.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop and compare the performance of Conv-BiLSTM and BiLSTM models for temperature forecasting. By utilizing deep learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of temperature predictions in the Tanjung Priok area.
